Google Play Store team is about to launch a new feature where in certain apps that are promising are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways – higher priority in recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”). These will also get a boost in visibility in search results. This feature will help bring more attention to newer apps that have potential.
